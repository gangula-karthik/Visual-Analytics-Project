# Visual-Analytics-Project



The visual analytics project that I have done at NYP during year 1 semester 2


This project aims to provide a data visualization report that verifies or disproves the hypothesis that Singapore is a good place to live and work in, based on the various factors that contribute to the quality of life. The team will gather requirements from a chosen key stakeholder to understand their needs and objectives for the report. Using Microsoft Power BI, the team will then provide a data-driven solution by applying ETL techniques, visualization techniques, and statistical modeling techniques.
